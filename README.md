putting together an app for Maryville SWDV655 Course



App Idea:  Fitness App
APP Name: PR-Gainz

Description:  
I would like to create a fitness app that engages individuals through competition and personal improvement metrics.  Each day a limited list of workouts will be released under each of the workout categories listed below.  The workouts will be constantly varied.  The workouts may be repeated occasionally throughout a calendar year, but not more than quarterly.  Each workout will also have three levels, beginner, intermediate, and advanced.  Depending on the complexity of movements there may be workouts that discuss how to scale the workout down further.  The user will have the opportunity to submit a “score” after completing a workout.  This score will be included in a leaderboard.  The user can customize their own leaderboard by gender, age, location, etc.  All user scores will be stored for future comparison.  When a workout is repeated, the app will indicate to the user that they have a past score recorded.  The user can use their new outcome to judge their progress.  

Features: 
Choose between various fitness categories
Examples: 
•	Bootcamp (with or without equipment)
•	Running (treadmill / outdoor)
•	Walking (treadmill / outdoor)
•	Hiking 
•	Biking (stationary / outdoor)
•	Crossfit 
•	Rowing
•	Yoga
•	Mobility / Stretching / Recovery
•	Weightlifting
•	Swimming


Add workout details to deliver appropriate workouts to the user
	For example: 
•	Indoor vs. outdoor workout
•	Type of equipment
•	Lower Body / Upper Body /Core workout
•	Road / Mountain / Gravel Bike
•	Length of Pool 
•	List of equipment available

Provide the user with options for the “workout of the day” list for each category.  I picture this list to be limited but changes each day.  The user can submit their score for the workout they choose, which will populate a custom leaderboard.  Workouts may repeat in the future and the app will track past user results.  Users can also filter their personalized leaderboard by age, gender, location, etc. 

Native Plugin Ideas: 
1.	Link heart monitoring wearable device via Bluetooth
